    <title>External Styling</title>
    <!--In real life external styling only used not internal or external-->
    <!-- To link/include css style sheet with the html we use link tag-->
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="index.css">
    <style>
        h1{color:firebrick;}
        p{color:aqua;}
    </style>

<!--In this example we are making use of styling techniches and trying to undestand the prorities of each read conclusion in the end after executing-->

</head>
<body>
    <h1>This is first headding in red</h1>
    <P>This pragraph is in lime green. Lorem, ipsum dolor sit amet consectetur adipisicing elit. Veritatis quasi placeat recusandae repellendus doloribus harum earum provident voluptas qui ut?</P>
    <h1 style="color:blueviolet;">This is second heading in blueviolet color</h1>
</body>
</html>


<!--In index.css file we have declared colurs as red and lime green but the color showing in the brower are firebrick(brownish) and aqua. and even the color of the 2nd heading is also not aqua its bluevoilet

    Conclusion:
    It means inline has the highest priority then internal styling then external styling.
    Note:Inline styling is not used as it is unproffessional as well as It mixes up the html code with the css code.
