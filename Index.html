    1.Element selector 
    (select each element one by one by element name and apply the styling)

    2.Universal selector 
    (Apply the property to all the elements on the page. But if defined explicity then it will not apply for that which means universal selector applies stylling to all the unstyled elements)

    (Instead of selecting one by select multiple elements at once and apply style togher at once. each element seperated by commas)
